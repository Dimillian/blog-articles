What an original title... yeah. 
But I finally have a blog associated to my [website](http://thomasricouard.info) now! 

For the curious, this blog use [Ghost](https://ghost.org) and it's hosted at [Heroku](http://heroku.com). Ghost doens't run out of the box on heroku, but it's really simple to make run on it. 
I followed this awesome blog [post](http://blog.johnny.io/how-to-get-ghost-running-on-heroku-for-free/) from Johnny Halife.
I also use the same theme as him at the moment, it's Vapor and you can find it [here](https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor), but I may change for a new one in the future.

Yeah all of that is not super original, but I plan to post cool things soon, I promise!
